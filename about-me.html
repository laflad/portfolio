      <h4>How I got to where I am today.</h4>

      <p>I'm originally from Québec, Canada in a little town far north called Val d'Or where no one spoke English. So, French is my first language. Some would say I have no accent, but that's because I was immersed in American culture when I was twelve years old.</p>
      <p>In 1997, My family moved from Québec to Tempe, Arizona in the middle of winter. I got off the plane in shorts and a t-shirt while the locals around were fully covered head to toe. It took me a few years to get acclimated, but I got used to it.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to today and I'm now back to a climate close to my original home. I love Washington state and all that it has to offer. When I'm not working, I love to play in my garden or discover new hikes. The winters are perfect for me to hibernate and relax inside while enjoying the rain.</p>
      <p>My work experience journey has been an interesting one and I wouldn't change it for anything. Out of high school, I attended community college for accounting. Most of my family members have careers revolving around numbers so it just made sense. I quickly learned that I was not built for accounting. The short story is I went from accounting to operations, to marketing and photography, to now design. After starting Marketing, I quickly realized my potential and decided to back to a full 4-year college to obtain a degree. So in my 30's I finally obtained my B.S. in Business Marketing from Menlo College. I now leverage my design experience with my degree and it partners really well for my work.</p>
      <p>Now, I'm embarking on Front-End Development to partner with my design experience. I'm excited to see what comes of it!</p>
